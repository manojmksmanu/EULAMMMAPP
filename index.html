      <h1>MegamindsApp :- End-User License Agreement (EULA)
        
      </h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated: December 09, 2024</strong></p>

      <h2>1. License Grant</h2>
      <p>
        MyMegaminds grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable
        license to use the MyMegaminds Application ("App") on your personal
        device solely for your personal or business use, in accordance with this
        EULA.
      </p>

      <h2>2. User Permissions and Data Handling</h2>

      <div class="section-title">2.1 File Access Permissions</div>
      <p>
        To enable the feature of sending files in chats, the app requires
        explicit permission to access the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device Storage</li>
        <li>Camera</li>
        <li>Photo Library</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you attempt to send files or projects, you will be prompted to
        grant the necessary permissions. Without these permissions, you will not
        be able to send any files or projects. However, users who do not require
        these functionalities can continue using other parts of the app without
        restrictions.

          Data may include your name, email address, phone number, device
          information, and any content you share or upload.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your data will only be stored temporarily and accessible as long as
          necessary to maintain core functionalities.
        </li>
      </ul>
